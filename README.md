# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program for the company. We need to get table for retiring employees and another table for the mentoship program. 

## Results
### Major Points
- Employees with Senior Engineer title had the **highest** amount of retiring individuals
- There are **90,398 individuals** who are retiring based on the birth dates from 01-01-1952 and 12-31-1955.
- There are 1,549 individuals who are **eligible** for the mentorship program.
- Employees with Manager as title had the **least** amount of retireing individuals. 

## Summary 
Overall, we were able to determine which people are soon to be retired and who is eligible for the employee mentorship program.
### Q/A
**1.** How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- The company will need to replace **90,398** roles within the company

**2.** Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- With the 1,549 individuals, the boss can only interpret if this is enough logistically. Now I would say this is not a lot of people considering the amount of new jobs this company has to re-hire in. 

### Additional Queries
- If we make another table where we group by departments that have the count of individuals who are mentorship eligible. This can give the manager an insight on which dpartment is going to worse off/ better off for the mentorship program. 
- If we make another table who are from years '1956-1960' this well determine the next wave after the silver-tsunami of retirement individuals. This can provide more insight to hiring manager and the CEO to perform courses of actions accordingly to determine future success of this company.
